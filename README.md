We've received a lot of great PR submissions from May to June. Some
are still waiting for reviews; we haven't forgotten and we will
respond soon.

The role we're hiring for at the moment is a **Senior full-stack dev**,
with experience working in Elixir and Phoenix. We started this project
late last year and it's currently in pre-production mode, where devops
experience is valuable along with a security-first mindset and fine
attention to detail as well.

We have more positions opening up over the next few months so we're
keep track of the submissions coming in and we'll send another update
as we know more. - QC

## Exercise

Write a function that compresses an alphanumeric string by collapsing consecutive values. The rules of the compression algorithm are defined by the test cases below.


## Test cases

Each item below has an input value and the expected output from the function.

1. `aaabccccdd` → `a3bc4d2`
2. `aaaaaffffffffffc` → `a5f10c`
3. `abcd` → `abcd` (note: not `a1b1c1d1`)
4. `ccceee12eccceee` → `c3e4c3e3` (numbers removed)
5. `effeac01cb65c` → `ef2eac2bc`

## Timeboxing

Try to complete this task within 30 minutes.


## What we'll be looking at

- Code structure — specifically how readable and understandable it is
    - (Optional) Consider using of whitespace and inline doc strings for clarity
- Git usage — granularity of commits and any branches or tags
- Edge cases — how they're handled so they won't be forgotten
    - (Optional) Describe or implement a solution for each case (if any)
- Bonus: Add a very basic test for each case


## What we won't be looking at

- Language — use whatever programming language you're most comfortable with
- Number of lines — it can be any length as long as it's readable and understandable
- Time spent — just be honest and tell us how you used the time
