  All of our open positions have been filled. As we bring on new members
  to the team, we to take time to let the dust settle before continuing.
  We find that we get a better picture that way of the role(s) that will
  have the most impact on our velocity.

  We'll have more positions opening up soon so we're still keeping track
  of the pull requests coming in. Some things we'll be interested in, in
  no particular order: Devops (PaaS), Dart, Python and libs like Pandas,
  Ruby, experience working in healthcare, compliance or various areas of
  research, and of course anything related to helping others to improve
  their mental-health & well-being.

  We are an equal opportunity employer. If you're not sure whether your
  skills and experience would be a good fit, please email us anyway and
  we can figure it out together. At the very least, we'll be pleased to
  offer you any constructive feedback we can (but only if you ask). ðŸŒ»

  This notice will be updated again as we have more details to share. - QC

# Exercise

Write a function that compresses an alphanumeric string by collapsing consecutive values. The rules of the compression algorithm are defined by the test cases below.


## Test cases

Each item below has an input value and the expected output from the function.

1. `aaabccccdd` â†’ `a3bc4d2`
2. `aaaaaffffffffffc` â†’ `a5f10c`
3. `abcd` â†’ `abcd` (note: not `a1b1c1d1`)
4. `ccceee12eccceee` â†’ `c3e4c3e3` (numbers removed)
5. `effeac01cb65c` â†’ `ef2eac2bc`

## Timeboxing

Try to complete this task within 30 minutes.


## What we look for

- Code structure â€” specifically how readable and understandable it is
    - (Optional) Consider using of whitespace and inline doc strings for clarity
- Git usage â€” granularity of commits and any branches or tags
- Edge cases â€” how they're handled so they won't be forgotten
    - (Optional) Describe or implement a solution for each case (if any)
- Bonus: Add a very basic test for each case


## What we _don't_ look for

- Language â€” use whatever programming language you're most comfortable with
- Number of lines â€” it can be any length as long as it's readable and understandable
- Time spent â€” just be honest and tell us how you used the time


## How to submit

1. Fork this repo to a public one on your account.
2. Add an empty file for your code and make a commit.
3. Make granular commits as you go so that each one is readible with an accurate commit message.
4. When you're done, submit your fork as a pull request back to this repo.
5. To help us stay organized, please email us at careers@quantifiedcitizen.com with the link and a few details about your experience and/or interest in working with us.
